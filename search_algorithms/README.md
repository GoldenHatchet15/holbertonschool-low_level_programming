# C Search Algorithms

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of classic search algorithms implemented in C. These algorithms are fundamental to computer science and have a wide range of applications in various fields. This project aims to provide clear and efficient implementations of these algorithms for educational and professional use.

## Algorithms Included
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted list in half until the desired element is found.
- **Jump Search**: A searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays and uses a fixed step to jump ahead instead of going through each element.
- **Interpolation Search**: An improved variant of binary search for instances where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed.
- **Exponential Search**: A search algorithm that starts by checking the first element and then repeatedly doubling the range until the desired element is found.
- **Fibonacci Search**: A search technique that uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the array into subarrays and then searches within them.
- [Add other algorithms as necessary]
